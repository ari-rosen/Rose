Rose is a 2D Game Engine written in C++ for MacOS that enables creation of 2D video games. Rose provides an Entity Component System, an Event System, and an OpenGL Rendering engine to allow the creation of complex 2D environments and gameplay. 

[Documentation](docs)

## Installation
An installation quick start guide can be found under [docs/InstallationGuide.md](docs/InstallationGuide.md)
> It is highly recomended to use CMake for your application, but not required


A tutorial for getting started can be found under [docs/(1)GettingStarted.md](docs/(1)GettingStarted.md) following sequential order (1) -> (2) -> (3) etc.

## Platform
Rose only supports MacOS (Sorry)

## Plan
The plan for Rose is to become a simple, easy to use framework for creating simple games that doesn't feel as overwhelming as a fully fledged AAA Game Engine feels. That being said, Rose will continue to receive features to improve the user experience of creating games.

### Planned Features
* Easier drawing features (drawing simple shapes like rectangles or circles)
* Editor Application
* Scene Serialization
* Windows Support (Not a top priority)
